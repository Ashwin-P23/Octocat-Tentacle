# Octocat Tentacle
We decided to create one of Mona's Octocat tentacle. This tentacle has a full 360 range of motion, using fibbinochi sequence and the logarthimic spiral as a reference to create the tentacle linkages to create a 16 link tentacle using a 4 string to motor system to have full motion control. Using the logarithimic spiral as a reference, allowing the tentacle to be able to crab small object, and have a full range of grabbing/wrapping.

## Materials/Properties
